I was honoured to hear that I was accepted to present my **<a href="/aadinternals" target="_new">AADInternals</a>** toolkit at the most respected information security event in the world: <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-19/" target="_blank">Black Hat USA 2019</a>. 
This is clearly one of my greatest professional achievements so far! 
In this blog, I’ll briefly introduce what to expect in <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-19/arsenal/schedule/#aadinternals-powershell-module-for-administering-azure-ad-and-office---16930" target="_blank">my demo at Black Hat Arsenal</a>.

# What is Black Hat Arsenal?
<a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-19/arsenal-overview.html" target="_blank">Black Hat Arsenal</a> is an event where researchers (as I) showcase the latest tools with live demonstrations. I’ll be at stage on **Wednesday Aug 7** at **2:30pm-3:50pm**.
# AADInternals demo
In my presentation, I’ll demonstrate how to use AADInternals to extract information from Office 365 / Azure AD tenants and how to exploit some more or less known vulnerabilities I’ve discovered during the past few years. 

Demo includes:

* Getting <a href="/aadinternals/#get-aadinttenantdomains-e" target="_blank">registered domains</a> of any tenant
* Abuse Azure AD connect APIs to <a href="/aadinternals/#user-manipulation-with-ad-sync-api" target="_blank">mimic directory synchronization</a>
* Creating a backdoor using <a href="/aadinternals/#install-aadintptaspy" target="_blank">pass-through authentication</a>
* Creating a backdoor using <a href="/aadinternals/#new-aadintbackdoor-a" target="_blank">identity federation</a>
* Bypassing security boundaries with <a href="/aadinternals/#send-aadinteasmessage-e" target="_blank">legacy protocols</a> and <a href="/aadinternals/#open-aadintoffice365portal" target="_blank">identity federation</a>
